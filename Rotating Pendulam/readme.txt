I have created two programs. One that rotates freely through 360 degrees and the other which takes gravity into account also has a damping effect.

The assignment program is named "prog2_Karthik.html" and the other program is named "realPendulum_Karthik.html".

Since outlook doesn't allow to send .js files, I am removing the extension. Kindly add the .js extension while running the program.

Feel free to check out both the programs.
